            <p class="text-muted">In my adolescent years. I struggled to find a role model or anyone I can look up to, that could guide me along my journey. I would be envious of my peers who would tell stories of their siblings, relatives or parents and how much they have
                inspired, guided or provided for them.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">Despite this and after graduating from secondary school and then attending ITE. My mindset of starting anew and openmindedness when i step foot into ITE, changed me in terms of how I look at things and my approach when it comes to work and
                life. I have found a great deal of satisfaction for learning, leading projects with my classmates and socializing. And only then, have I taken things into my own hands and gotten more confident to lead, guide, and act as my own role model.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">I am an ambitious person, always in pursuit for something and I am keen on improving myself each day. I hold myself in high regards and I intend to contribute as much as I can to society while I am here! </p>
            <p class="text-muted">In my free time I enjoy exploring film and music genres, listening to podcasts talking about philosophies or anything in general or having a prolonged conversations with my friends. I have only recently taken up interest in cooking and writing,
                I must say it's fun to look at recipes and fantasizing about preparing them. For now I am just going to stick with my salty burnt chicken breast and plain rice. I will update this if there are any developments in the cooking department.</p>

                                come up with a new process (improve the existing one) of handling the operation in the warehouse that utilizes excel spreadsheets. This lead to a boost in productivity and a more efficient operation. </p>

                                details/feasibility. Using my previous project: <strong>MyBio</strong>, I developed a business model, researched on the market and pitched it to my lecturers. Safe to say that after getting distinction, it proved that I
                                have developed my presentation and communication skills.
